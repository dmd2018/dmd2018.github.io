    "long": "As full sighted people, we often take for the advantage the ease that sight brings to our lives, from enjoying the view outside our bedroom window, knowing what breed of dog is in front of us to sensing social cues through body language such as smiling or frowning. However, for blind people they have no such advantages, they cannot preserve the world around them via sight. That is my mobile application Sight comes in. It will allow a user to navigate their environment helping them find, objects they are looking for without assistance from another person, helping them identify close family and friends and even read.",

The project is designed as an alternative to using a laptop in the kitchen to aid cooking to access recipes or online videos.  As most modern smartphones are waterproof, they act as the perfect medium to access digital content in the kitchen. These recipe cards give aspiring cooks the choice to read the recipe from the card or view an online tutorial, all with the tap of their smartphone. ",
